# SE-Europe-Data_Challenge_Template

## About the Project

Welcome to the SE-Europe-Data_Challenge_Template, part of the NUWE - Schneider Electric European Data Science Challenge in November 2023. This repository is designed to facilitate research and innovation in sustainable and clean energy across Europe. Our goal is to harness the power of data science to foster solutions that contribute to energy sustainability and efficiency.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Pandas library
- SQLite3

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/SE-Europe-Data_Challenge_Template.git
   ```
2. Install the required packages:
   ```sh
   pip install pandas
   ```

## Usage

This repository includes a Python script `create_db.py` for creating and managing a SQLite database with data relevant to sustainable and clean energy in Europe.

To use the script:
1. Ensure you have the required CSV files in the specified directory.
2. Run the script with the desired database name:
   ```sh
   python create_db.py database_name
   ```

## Results
Once we got the CSV files from the data ingestion script we started working.

1. We first observed the behavior of the time series.
![DA_normal_features]
We also noticed weir behaviors such like in UK
![DA_unnormal_features]
